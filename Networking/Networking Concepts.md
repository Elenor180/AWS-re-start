# Networking concepts

I delved deep into networking fundamentals, gaining hands-on experience through the AWS Console.
I started by understanding the core components of Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) â€” including subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and NAT gateways and learned how they work together to securely segment cloud environments. 
I practiced creating custom VPCs, assigning CIDR blocks, and configuring public and private subnets for different application needs. 
I also explored security groups and network ACLs to control inbound and outbound traffic. Through the AWS Console, I set up Elastic IPs, configured DNS with Route 53, and used VPC peering to enable communication between isolated networks. 
This hands-on exposure built my confidence in deploying secure, scalable, and efficient network architectures in AWS
