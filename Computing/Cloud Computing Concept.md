# Cloud computing concepts

I worked extensively with core AWS services to develop and deploy cloud-based solutions. 
I launched and configured EC2 instances for compute workloads, hosted static websites using Amazon S3 with proper permissions and lifecycle settings, 
and built serverless applications using AWS Lambda with S3 triggers, scheduled events, and API Gateway integrations. 
I also containerized applications and deployed them using ECS and Docker, and automated resource provisioning and deployments through the AWS CLI. 
Throughout, I applied cloud-native concepts such as elasticity, scalability, and stateless architecture to build efficient and reliable systems.
