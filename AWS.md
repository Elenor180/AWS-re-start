# AWS-re-start
## My AWS re/start journey documented


The AWS re/Start program provided me with comprehensive, hands-on training designed to prepare individuals for entry-level roles in cloud computing. Over the course of this intensive program, I am developing a solid foundation in cloud infrastructure, computing principles, and professional practices expected from a junior cloud engineer.

##  Core Areas Covered

### Python Programming (Foundational to Intermediate)
- Wrote scripts to automate tasks, parse data, and interact with AWS services
- Applied core programming concepts including functions, conditionals, loops, error handling, and data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- Built small-scale projects to reinforce logic and automation in cloud workflows

### Linux Fundamentals
- Navigated and operated Linux systems using the command line (CLI)
- Managed files and directories, configured permissions, and used tools like `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `vi`, and `chmod`
- Monitored system performance and ran basic system-level commands for administration
- Set up and managed user accounts and processes

### Cloud Computing Concepts
- Understood the AWS global infrastructure including Regions, Availability Zones, and Edge Locations
- Learned about scalability, elasticity, high availability, disaster recovery, and fault tolerance
- Practiced the **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**, cloud security best practices, and cost optimization strategies
- Applied knowledge of compute, storage, networking, and database services

### AWS Core Services (Hands-On Practice)
- **EC2**: Launched, configured, and managed virtual machines; used key pairs, security groups, and custom AMIs
- **S3**: Created buckets, managed permissions, hosted static websites, versioning, lifecycle policies
- **IAM**: Managed users, groups, roles, and policies with a focus on the principle of least privilege
- **Lambda**: Built serverless functions, connected them to events (e.g., S3 triggers), and used them for automation
- **VPC**: Designed virtual networks, set up subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and security layers
- **CloudWatch**: Monitored resources, configured alarms, and analyzed logs
- **AWS CLI**: Used the command line to automate deployments, manage services, and perform batch operations

### Containers & Automation
- Understood container concepts with Docker
- Learned basic CI/CD principles
- Worked on automation using AWS CLI and explored infrastructure-as-code concepts
