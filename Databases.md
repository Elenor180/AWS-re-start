# Databases

During my AWS re/Start journey, I gained practical knowledge of cloud-based database concepts, focusing on both relational and non-relational models. 
Using the AWS Management Console, I worked with Amazon RDS to launch and manage relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, 
learning about automated backups, multi-AZ deployments, and read replicas for high availability and performance. 
I also explored Amazon DynamoDB to understand NoSQL principles, including partition keys, sort keys, and throughput settings. 
This hands-on experience taught me how to provision, secure, and monitor databases in the cloud, emphasizing scalability, reliability, and data integrity.
