# Network Hardening Using Amazon Inspector and AWS Systems Manager

Securing an infrastructure can be a challenge for any company. 
Companies use many tools to audit networks and find vulnerabilities in systems and applications. 
This process takes significant time and effort.

In this lab, I am a new security engineer for AnyCompany. 
I need to identify weak areas in the company's network security and update AnyCompany's environment for better efficiency and optimization. 
I will use Amazon Inspector to do this


## Objectives 


Configure Amazon Inspector
Run an agentless network audit
Investigate the scan results
Update security groups
Log in to an application server instance using AWS Systems Manager Session Manager.
