# Building a DB Server and Interacting With the DB Using an App

This documented lab demonstrates the concept of leveraging an AWS-managed database instance for solving relational database need.

Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. 
It provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration tasks, which allows you to focus on your applications and business. 
Amazon RDS provides you with six familiar database engines to choose from: Amazon Aurora, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB.
